Mating Type Switching


This programme is written in C++. Each pair of .cpp and .hpp file is written for different groups of functions. The .cpp files include the relevant code and the .hpp files the relevant headers. All functions are called in the main.cpp and you may run the program by compiling all .cpp files. Below is a short description of each file. Each function in the code comes with a brief description. 

* * *

Global.hpp: a header file where global parameters are defined

Main.cpp: the main file where the program is run. All parameters and arrays are defined here.

Initiation.cpp: includes functions that are used to initiate arrays

Functions.cpp: includes all the functions called in the central loop of main.cpp. 

WriteFiles.cpp: includes functions that are called in main.cpp to store data as text files.
