Mating Type Switching


This programme is written in C++. Each pair of .cpp and .hpp file is written for different groups of functions. The .cpp files include the relevant code and the .hpp files the relevant headers. All functions are called in the main.cpp and you may run the program by compiling all .cpp files. Below is a short description of each file.
